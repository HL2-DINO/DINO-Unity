## Overview

A sample Unity 2021 project which consumes the [`DINO-DLL`](https://github.com/HL2-DINO/DINO-DLL) project and creates a Unity app for the HoloLens 2 to position virtual models based on infrared tracking data.

This is a demo-app showcasing the tool-tracking work we describe in our publication [Semi-Automatic Infrared Calibration for Augmented Reality Systems in Surgery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9982215)<sup>[1]</sup> by Hisham Iqbal & Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena. 


### What does this app do?
This project can be used in its current state to allow the HoloLens 2 to track two tools which can be 3D printed and assembled as described in [`DINO-IR-Tools`](
https://github.com/HL2-DINO/DINO-IR-Tools). 


### How do I use and customise the app?
Check out the [tutorials documentation](./Tutorials.md) for more information on topics like:

1. What's included in this app
2. How to print performance/profiling data for the IR tracking
3. Adding your own custom tools/geometries
4. How information is exchanged between the C++ [`DINO-DLL`](https://github.com/HL2-DINO/DINO-DLL) and `DINO-Unity`

## Requirements

1. Unity 2021 (2021.3.2f1 was used for this project)
2. Enable Research Mode on your HoloLens 2: [see tutorial here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/research-mode#enabling-research-mode-hololens-first-gen-and-hololens-2)
3. Visual Studio (for this project, [Visual Studio 2022 configured for Unity development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/gamedev/unity/get-started/getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-for-unity?pivots=windows) was used during testing)
4. The project has a dependency on **Newtonsoft JSON.NET**, which was included through Unity's Package Manager: *[Add package from git URL] -> 'com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json'*
5. 3-D printing and assembling two tools, as included in [`DINO-IR-Tools`](
https://github.com/HL2-DINO/DINO-IR-Tools).  

## Getting Started
> **Note:** These steps assume no changes to the Unity project. If you need to change tool geometries, [double check the tutorials](./Tutorials.md) to make sure you've configured everything properly.

1. If you have made any changes to [`DINO-DLL`](https://github.com/HL2-DINO/DINO-DLL), then make sure you copy over the latest `HL2DinoPlugin.winmd` and `HL2DinoPlugin.dll` files into the folder: `Assets/Plugins/WSA`

2. Unity build settings: 
    - Target Device: HoloLens
    - Architecture: ARM64
    - Build Type: D3D Project

3. Build, and then open the Visual Studio `.sln` file. Add the 'restricted capability' to the `Package.appxmanifest` file.

   As per the instructions provided on the [HoloLens2-ResearchMode-Unity](https://github.com/petergu684/HoloLens2-ResearchMode-Unity/tree/master) README.md by petergu684, make the following modifications to your `Package.appxmanifest`.

    Add `xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities" ` and `IgnorableNamespaces="uap uap2 uap3 uap4 mp mobile iot rescap"` to the file, and add in the necessary capabilities.

    Your resulting app manifest should look something like:

    ```xml 
    <Package 
    xmlns:mp="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/2014/phone/manifest" 
    xmlns:uap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10" 
    xmlns:uap2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/2" 
    xmlns:uap3="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/3" 
    xmlns:uap4="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/4" 
    xmlns:iot="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/iot/windows10" 
    xmlns:mobile="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/mobile/windows10" 
    xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities" 
    IgnorableNamespaces="uap uap2 uap3 uap4 mp mobile iot rescap" 
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10"> 
    ```
    ```xml
    <Capabilities>
        <rescap:Capability Name="perceptionSensorsExperimental" />
        <Capability Name="internetClient" />
        <Capability Name="internetClientServer" />
        <Capability Name="privateNetworkClientServer" />
        <uap2:Capability Name="spatialPerception" />
        <DeviceCapability Name="webcam" />
    </Capabilities>
    ```

4. Ensure your `.sln` is set up to build for `Release` and `ARM64`, and then deploy to the HoloLens
5. You will most likely need to restart your headset the first time you deploy. To do this, just use the standard voice command `"Restart device"`  
6. After restarting, if everything has gone to plan, you should see something like the GIF in the Overview section (e.g. updating sensor images and tool tracking)

* The project structure for consuming a C++/WinRT component and logic for handling incoming DLL data was inspired by [HoloLens2-ResearchMode-Unity](https://github.com/petergu684/HoloLens2-ResearchMode-Unity/tree/master) by petergu684. Check it out for a very good insight into how you can visualise other sensor-streams from the HoloLens 2.

### To-Do List
There are a few features which are yet to be implemented and are left for future TODO's.

On the Unity side:

ðŸ”² Make the palm UI menu voice-activated

ðŸ”² Moving the tool config file location into a place where users can easily change tool geometries at runtime without having to recompile the app.
